# Decision Trees — Lecture W4 Cheat Sheet

A crisp, exam-ready summary of Decision Trees, splitting criteria, pruning, cross‑validation, and evaluation, tailored to your slides.

## What is a Decision Tree?

- A supervised learning model that recursively partitions the input space and predicts by majority vote (classification) or average (regression) in leaves.
- Learns human‑readable IF–THEN rules, e.g., IF Outlook = Overcast THEN Play = Yes.

## Core algorithms

- ID3 (Quinlan, 1986): uses Information Gain (entropy) to choose splits; handles categorical features.
- C4.5: successor to ID3; handles continuous features via thresholds, deals with missing values, uses Gain Ratio.
- CART (Breiman et al., 1984/85): uses Gini for classification and MSE for regression; binary splits only; basis for scikit‑learn trees.

## How trees are built (high level)

1. Pick the split that best reduces impurity (highest gain, lowest Gini/MSE).
2. Create a child for each split outcome.
3. Recurse on each child until a stopping rule triggers.

Typical stopping rules (pre‑pruning):

- Max depth, min samples to split, min samples per leaf, min impurity decrease, class purity at node.

## Handling different feature types

- Categorical: multiway split, one‑vs‑rest, or grouped categories.
- Continuous/real‑valued: learn a threshold t and split on x_j ≤ t vs > t.
- Regression: choose splits that minimize node mean squared error (MSE).

## Overfitting and pruning

- Overfitting: tree memorizes noise; high training accuracy, poor generalization.
- Pre‑pruning (early stopping): control growth with hyperparameters (max_depth, min_samples_split, min_samples_leaf, min_impurity_decrease).
- Post‑pruning (cost‑complexity pruning): grow full tree, then trim branches using a penalty α for tree size (ccp_alpha). Select α via validation or cross‑validation.

## Cross‑validation (detect/avoid overfitting)

- Holdout: simple train/test split (e.g., 50/50). Fast, higher bias.
- LOOCV: train on n−1, test on 1; repeats n times. Low bias, high variance, slow.
- Stratified k‑Fold: preserves class ratios in each fold; essential for imbalanced data.
- k‑Fold (often k=10): rotate which fold is test; balances bias/variance.

## Evaluation highlights

- Accuracy can be misleading with class imbalance; prefer Precision/Recall and F1 when positives are rare/costly.
- F1 balances Precision and Recall; useful when you need a single score reflecting both.

## Quick build recipe (classification)

- Compute impurity at node: use Entropy (ID3/C4.5) or Gini (CART).
- For each feature:
  - Categorical: evaluate splits per value (or grouped), compute weighted child impurity.
  - Continuous: sort unique values; evaluate midpoints as thresholds.
- Pick the split with maximum impurity reduction (gain) and recurse.
- Stop when a stopping rule fires; assign leaf label by majority class.

## Practical tips

- Prefer Stratified CV when classes are imbalanced; report F1, not just accuracy.
- Shallow trees (lower max_depth) generalize better; prune with validation, not training error.
- For regression trees, also check MAE if outliers dominate; MSE is more sensitive to outliers.
- Random Forest is a strong default: lower variance than a single tree with similar bias.

## scikit‑learn knobs (for quick use)

- Classification: `DecisionTreeClassifier(criterion="gini"|"entropy"|"log_loss", max_depth=..., min_samples_leaf=..., ccp_alpha=...)`
- Regression: `DecisionTreeRegressor(criterion="squared_error", max_depth=..., min_samples_leaf=..., ccp_alpha=...)`
- Post‑pruning path: use `cost_complexity_pruning_path` to pick `ccp_alpha` via CV.

## Tiny mnemonic

- Entropy/IG: “information‑hungry” (choose the most informative split).
- CART/Gini: “fast and binary.”
- Pruning: “grow, then trim with α.”
- CV: “stratify when in doubt.”
